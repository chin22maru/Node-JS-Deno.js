- How we works?
    - Client (e.g., a web browser) enters a URL in the address bar.
    - The browser performs a domain lookup to find the IP address of the server hosting the website.
    - The client sends an HTTP request to the server.
    - The server runs your code (e.g., a Node.js app) to process the request.
    - If needed, your code queries the database to fetch or store data.
    - The server generates a response (HTML, JSON, etc.) and sends it back to the client.
    - The client receives the response and renders the webpage.

- Req/Res transmission done through HTTP/HTTPS protocol
